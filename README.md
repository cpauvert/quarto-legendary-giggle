# quarto-legendary-giggle
Testing Quarto presentations and index pages via Github pages


## Versions

### v1.0

- has not custom fonts (the `fonts` directory did not made it up to the `gh-pages` branch)
- was published using `quarto publish gh-pages` from the Rstudio terminal using the docker instance (see [`compose.yml`](compose.yml))
- local git repository needed to use HTTPS for cloning because the docker container does not have ssh installed
